 - Notes:
  * we need to update the site each time the db is updated from ANYWHERE, not just from the current session.
  * there must be 2 views:
    - the current schedule with all the days and hour intervals.
    - the schedule for each room for current week.
  * option to announce if a course will not be held in order to announce other profs for a potential re-schedule.
  * option to quickly find a room for a re-schedule with desired hour and day as input.
    - usage: reschedule [-t time] [-r fav_room]
  * regarding students: account registration would be too much. better, opt to announce via mail or sms potential changes/updates of a selected group!
  * option to export selected group to Google Calendar, .csv etc.
  * option to acces api for given groups.
